  <p>This platform has been developed in order to annotate templates which would be used in an academic project which aims to detect and count
    automatically banana trees in a farm.</p>
  <p>Please click on Image on the bottom to start annotating pictures.</p>
  <p class="text-danger">I recommend to use this platform with Google Chrome.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your help.</p>
